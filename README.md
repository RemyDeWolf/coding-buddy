# coding-buddy

Improve your coding skills by practicing coding exercises.
* Classic set of exercises: frequently asked in interviews or computer science tests.
* Practice the exercises over and over and try to improve your time and reach the gold level.
* Each exercise comes with:
    * a pre-configured project, so you don't waste time with the setup and can code right away.
    * a set of tests to verify the implementation.
    * a solution for reference.
* Extensible framework: you can add your own exercise and submit a PR for it, see [exercises](exercises) guidelines.
